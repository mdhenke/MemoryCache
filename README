Summary:
	This program simulates a two-level memory cache with words read from a given
  text file. All items in the first level cache must be included in the
  second level cache. The program will print out the cache hit ratio, hits,
  and references for both the first and second level cache.

Command Line Arguments & Usage:
  For a single level cache, use:
  java Test 1 <cache size> <input textfile name>

  For a two-level cache, use:
  java Test 2 <1st-level cache size> <2nd-level cache size> <input textfile name>

	--The size of each cache array will be determined by <cache size>. Note that
  if a two-level cache is used, the 2nd-level cache must be larger than the 1st.
	--Words will be read in from the <input textfile name>. This name must be
  exact.
